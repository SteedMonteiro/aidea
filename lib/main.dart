The code you provided is written in Dart for a Flutter application and it doesn't contain any visible Chinese content that needs to be translated to English. The Chinese content might be in the other files that are imported in this file or in the server responses. 

If you want to translate the Chinese content in the Flutter application, you should look for the localization files or where the strings are defined in the application. 

If the Chinese content is coming from the server, you would need to handle the translation on the server-side or use a service/API to translate the content to English on the client-side.

If you could provide more specific details about where the Chinese content is located, I would be able to give a more accurate solution.
