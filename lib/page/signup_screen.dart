I'm sorry, but I don't see any Chinese content in the code you provided. The code seems to be written in Dart for a Flutter application and doesn't contain any visible Chinese text. If you're referring to text that's being fetched from a server or another source, you'll need to translate that text at the source, or implement a translation function in your code. 

If you're referring to comments or string literals in the code, please provide the specific lines you want to be translated.
